"Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas and Numpy"

Problem Statement: 
This data refers to sales transactions at a store. Each transaction is described by five pieces of information: the date of the sale, the store location, the department within the store where the sale took place, the product that was sold, and the amount of the sale in dollars. 

For example : 
if a customer purchased a Mandalay at a store in New York on January 1st, the information for that sale might be: 
● Date        :  January 1st 
● Store       :  New York 
● Department  :  Food and beverages 
● Payment     :  Mode of payment 
● Total       :  $500.00 

With this data : 
We can analyze various aspects of the store's sales, such as which departments and products are the most popular, or how sales have changed over time. 
Additionally, you can compare sales across different stores or departments to identify trends and opportunities for improvement.

● Date            :   Date of the sale 
● Store Location  : Store location 
● Department      : Department of the store 
● Total           : $500.00 
● Payment         : Mode of payment
